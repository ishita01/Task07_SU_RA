Role: Senior Data Analyst at an automotive marketplace.
Task: Using the validated stats below, propose tiered recommendations (Operational, Investigatory, High-stakes). Include explicit uncertainty. Do not assert causality.

Validated stats:
- Global mean price: 14,716,258.95 (units as recorded).
- EV â€“ Petrol (trimmed at 99th pct): estimate = -40,884.822; 95% CI = [-63,425.578, -21,228.378]; ~ -0.28% of global mean.
- Untrimmed gap is negative but with a very wide CI; high outlier sensitivity.
- Subgroup counts are uneven across (Company, Fuel).

Output format: 
            1) Executive one-liner, 
            2) Tiered recommendations with metrics to monitor, 
            3) Risks/mitigations, 
            4) Dependencies, 
            5) Exactly where uncertainty could flip the decision.
